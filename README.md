Setup scripts for Open-Source IC Design.

Use `iic-osic-setup.sh` to setup or update a complete analog/digital IC design environment in Ubuntu/Xubuntu. Please see the script for usage and the installed tools.

The setup script creates an initialization script in the user's home directory. Use it to setup the environment by running

`source ~/iic-init.sh`
